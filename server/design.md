# Design

The game design is a work-in-progress. The fairly vague primary goal is to create a multiplayer game with a great base experience, such as smooth framerates and fine control over the player's character even at higher latencies (the target is 150ms).

The game's genre is **RPG**. The gameplay will focus around near-**infinite progression** and **dungeon crawling**. The player will progress through dungeons, which scale to the player's level and experience, delivering greater rewards by putting the player through varied challenges at ever-increasing difficulty.

The gameplay should be moderately **fast-paced**, with a great variety of abilities and items to use. Items are obtained through drops, dungeon chests, quests, and trading. Abilities are obtained through a skill tree. 

The skill tree enables a slight twist on the concept of levels. The player's level is the sum of all of their abilities' ranks. You increase the rank of your abilities by using them in combat. Upon reaching an ability's "master" rank, a new set of abilities unlocks, and the player gains a fixed amount of "ability points" to use on unlocking new abilities to master. This way, players "build their own class". It is possible to refund ability points, at the cost of losing progress.
